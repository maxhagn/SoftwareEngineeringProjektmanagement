# Software Engineering and Projektmanagement

This repository contains a ticket store for events that we had to develop as a team in the scope of the course Software Development and Project Management at the Vienna University of Technology. The backend is written with the framework Spring Boot based on Java. The frontend uses the framework Angular. The goal of the project was to plan and finally implement a complete software project as a team.
